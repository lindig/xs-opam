The `packages/` directory contains Opam entries for each package. These
can be copied *untouched* from other, existing Opam repositories. The
`packages/` is basically what you get when using this repository as a
remote Opam repository. A typical entry consists of three files:

    descr
    opam
    url

[Opam]:   http://opam.ocaml.org
[OCaml]:  http:/ocaml.org
